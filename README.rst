###########

Templatekit is a Python library and command-line app for using and maintaining a centralized repository of project and file templates.
Templates are built with Cookiecutter_ and Jinja_.
https://github.com/lsst/templates is the primary repository that Templatekit is built for, but Templatekit is fairly generic.
