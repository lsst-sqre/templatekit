0.6.0 (2023-10-13)
==================

- Add a new ``-i/--ignore`` option to the ``templatekit check`` command.
  This option allows the user to ignore certain files when checking for untracked files or dirty Git state after regenerating examples.
  This is useful for files that have dynamic content, such as dates and times, that we do not expect to be consistent.
- Migrate the packaging to ``pyproject.toml`` and retire the ``setup.cfg`` and ``setup.py`` files.
- Migrate to the new Rubin user guide theme for documentation.
- Add GitHub Actions workflow to update pre-commit hooks with Neophile.
- Adopted the PyPI trusted publishers workflow.

0.5.1 (2022-03-15)
==================

- Fix an incorrect import in the SCons builder.
- Fix reporting of SCons status in ``templatekit check``.

0.5.0 (2022-03-15)
==================

- Update build system to current SQuaRE standards.
- Add type annotations for all code.
- Unpin all dependencies for easier use as a library.

0.4.1 (2020-02-26)
==================

- The click dependency is no longer pinned.
  This fixes compatibility with cookiecutter 1.7, which requires click 7.

0.4.0 (2019-10-15)
==================

- Added a new ``templatekit check`` command.
  This command helps both developers and CI scripts ensure that the template repository is well-structured and that all examples are up-to-date.
  The ``templatekit check`` command runs ``scons`` to regenerate examples, and then checks the Git state to ensure that there are no untracked or modified files, which might indicate that there are uncommitted changes to examples.
- Internally, the ``templatekit.Repo`` class exposes a ``git.Repo`` instance from GitPython_.
  See ``templatekit.Repo.gitrepo``, ``templatekit.Repo.is_git_dirty``, and ``templatekit.Repo.untracked_files``.

0.3.0 (2019-10-08)
==================

- A new Jinja filter, ``escape_yaml_doublequoted``, is available as part of the ``templatekit.TemplatekitExtension``.
  This filter is meant to be used with template variables that are inside double-quoted string fields in a YAML file.
  The filter escapes both double quote characters (``"``) and backslash characters (``\``).
- There is a new "Template developer" guide, which lists the ``escape_yaml_doublequoted`` filter and provides tips on how to write YAML files in templates.
- The development procedure is now part of the documentation, rather than the README.

0.2.0 (2019-04-16)
==================

- New support for ``templatekit.yaml`` files.
  These files, which get added alongside ``cookiecutter.json`` files, refine the presentation of templates in Slack user interactions (see the Templatebot_ project).
  For example, templates have nice names (``name`` field) and can be grouped in selection menus (``group_name`` field).
  The ``dialog_fields`` field provides configuration for fields in the Slack dialogs where a user configures their new file or project.
- `Cerberus <http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ is a new dependency of Templatekit.
  ``templatekit.yaml`` files are validated against a Cerberus schema.

0.1.1 (2019-01-07)
==================

- Fix typo in PyPI classifiers that prevented deployment to PyPI.
- Fix setup.py so that setuptools_scm is activated.

0.1.0 (2019-01-07)
==================

- Extracted Templatekit from https://github.com/lsst/templates.
  By splitting the Templatekit application from the templates repository, we can version Templatekit and release it through PyPI.

- Versioning with `setuptools_scm <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools_scm/>`__.

- Sphinx documentation site.
